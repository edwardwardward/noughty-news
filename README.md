A small single page javascript news app that parses real news articles using the Guardian API.
It then summarises and displays the articles using Aylien API.

## Set Up
(We're assuming you're on a mac, vaguely know what you're doing and that you have homebrew installed. Install [homebrew here](https://brew.sh/). This isn't overly helpful but we've been learning for only 7 weeks so be gentle)

### 1) Install Node

This cracking installation needs Node.
In your terminal run:
```
  brew install node
```

### 2) Download Required Node Packages

```
  cd file/location/of/napkin-notes

```

### 3) Start the local server
```
node beNoughty
```
### 4) Open in your browser
Check out the following into your URL bar in your browser:

and Voila! Useless news for your delectation!
