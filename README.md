# Noughty News
## Delivering news of absolutely nought value.
A small single page javascript news app that parses real news articles using the Guardian API.
It then summarises and displays the articles using Aylien API.


## Set Up
(We're assuming you're on a mac, vaguely know what you're and that you have homebrew installed. Install [homebrew here](https://brew.sh/). This isn't overly helpful but we've been learning for only 7 weeks so be gentle)

### Install Node

This cracking installation needs Node.
In your terminal run:
```
  brew install node
```

###Â Download Reqired Node Packages
```
  cd file/location/of/napkin-notes
  npm install
```

### Start the local server

node beNoughty
```
### Open in your browser

and Voila! Useless news for your delectation!
