Why pretend otherwise?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/27/call-of-duty-wwii-activision-realism-killing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/apr/27/call-of-duty-wwii-activision-realism-killing","fields":{"body":"<p>There is a new Call of Duty video game coming out this November, and like the first three titles in the long-running, hugely successful series, it will be set during the second world war. Over the course of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/n2wNC5TYjyw\">a 45-minute livestreamed announcement event</a> on Wednesday night, developer Sledgehammer laid out its vision for the new military shooter: a gritty but authentic evocation of the conflict, following a young recruit to the US Army’s First Infantry division as it storms the beaches at Normandy then trudges through Europe towards Germany. The studio heads spent time talking about the realism and respect of their project, and the painstaking accuracy put into the development process.</p> <p>The whole thing felt distinctly uncomfortable. </p> <p>It’s not so much the sheer familiarity of the game’s setting – though that is somewhat disappointing. Operation Overlord, with its visually dramatic seaborne invasion, has provided material to video game developers for decades, lending a backdrop to the Medal of Honor and Brothers in Arms titles, as well as many earlier war simulations. And let’s be honest, the opening 20 minutes of Steven Spielberg’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/06/d-day-landings-on-film-hollywoods-wwii-tributes\">Saving Private Ryan</a>, a stark, pulverising recreation of the beach landings, must be seared into the consciousness of every writer and creative team thinking about setting a fiction in this conflict. It has become almost unavoidable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4Q_XYVescc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4Q_XYVescc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Then, of course, there is the familiar narrative set-up – the untested young private in a major US infantry unit, leaving behind his life in rural America to fight and perhaps die on the beaches of FRance, or in the forests and villages of Belgium. Of course, there are valid storytelling reasons why the raw recruit is such a familiar character in war fiction; they provide a surrogate for the viewer, initiated into the horror of war at the same time as us, channeling our shock and awe. But as countless war films, from Saving Private Ryan to Cross of Iron have shown, there are fascinating, very different tales to tell through the eyes of experienced soldiers. It would have made a compelling change for a video game, and there are different ways to teach a player about their role in the world.</p> <p>The trailer has all the beats we expect: the battle-worn sergeants yelling at each other, the grizzled veteran telling the protagonist, “You’re not in Texas anymore”; the exploding tank shells, the jump cuts, the panic. These are the go-to images and verbal ticks of the mainstream war story, repeated almost as shamanic incantations of duty, honour and sacrifice. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/25/call-of-duty-wwii-historians-video-games-activision\">Call of Duty: WWII</a> we are told will be about a small platoon of 12 soldiers and the relationship they build. Pals fighting for each other rather than some unknowable cause. Sacrifice and brotherhood. You know the drill.</p> <p>To their huge credit, the founders of Sledgehammer, Michael Condrey and Glen Schofield, emphasised that this would be a diverse story, taking in British troops and French resistance fighters. But of course, the lens we must view this global conflict through is American. While Battlefield 1 made the controversial decision to portion its narrative up into separate yet interconnected tales, CoD: WWII seems very much rooted in the experience of Ronald “Red” Daniels and his friends. It would be fascinating, one day, to have the whole of a massive mainstream WWII video game told through the eyes of a French resistance fighter, a Soviet soldier (a perspective featured briefly in Call of Duty 1 and 2), or an Indian paratrooper fighting in the Battle of Sangshak. Ubisoft’s gentle but evocative Valiant Hearts showed us what can be done with games and war when viewed from a different perspective.</p> <p>But the underlying discomfort for some will be this highly telegraphed commitment to authenticity, this bowed historical reverence, which was (intentionally or not) paraded as a marketing attribute on Wednesday evening. This is Call of Duty – a series built on turbo-charged, hyper-real combat, a game about twitch-based skill in a glinting world of highly choreographed mega explosions and a game of skittish, attention-deficit narrative beats that pummel the player like endless drum rolls. From the very beginning, the genius of Call of Duty was its shameless appropriation of epic war movie tropes to create a wild, exhilarating shooter experience. There is nothing authentic about the way Call of Duty – or any other shooter game – depicts warfare. You can accurately recreate all the weapons, battles and locations (and CoD: WII clearly does this beautifully), but this is not going to be an authentic evocation of the infantry experience. It’s going to be about running around with a machine gun, killing and respawning for hundreds of hours. And that’s fine. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Perhaps it is a measure of the games industry’s continuing sense of narrative and cultural illegitimacy that great developers still need to strive for the authentic. Sometimes, it is not necessary, and sometimes it just jars. In the preview event, the focus went very quickly from a discussion about the depth and detail of the historical research, and the determination to depict an emotional, truthful story, to a section about the game’s zombie nazi mode. It was so dissonant and tonally strange, it was almost unwatchable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a074505dd963aa76329dfcd5916a0225f1bb9cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a074505dd963aa76329dfcd5916a0225f1bb9cc/0_0_1631_979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Call of Duty WWII\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Call of Duty WWII</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Activision</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Why always strive for authenticity, why make these gestures, when fiction is perfectly capable of portraying any historical event through more subversive perspectives? Why did Call of Duty have to look towards <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/sep/24/features.mattseaton\">Band of Brothers </a>or Saving Private Ryan, and not <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/23/inglourious-basterds-philip-french\">Inglourious Basterds</a>, Dirty Dozen or Cross of Iron, movies that unapologetically revelled in their fictitious, accelerated and theatrical interpretation of war? The Call of Duty ethos is much more in line with Tarantino than it is with Spielberg – it’s much more about the raw, anarchic enjoyment of violence as a spectacle . Why not just go with it?</p> <p>Many of the team at Sledgehammer worked on the astonishing sci-fi horror game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/oct/16/microsoft-dead-space\">Dead Space</a>. That was a title that took a lot of ideas about science fiction, monster movies and psychological horror and twisted them into something genuinely thrilling and unusual. Imagine that spirit, that sense of chaos, claustrophobia and dread, placed into a WWII-era game about a raid on a Nazi stronghold. It would be amazing. (Okay, it would probably also be the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/20/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review-schlock-horror-hijinks\">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a>.)</p> <p>Of course, Activision and Sledgehammer are free to tell the story they want to tell – and crucially the story they need to sell to their audience. But there is such an overwhelming disparity between the narrative of sacrifice, truth and loss, and the reality of playing a Call of Duty game. And there is nothing wrong with the way Call of Duty games work, the way they distort ideas of military power and conflict into discrete sense-shattering encounters. It’s fun. It doesn’t have to be justified, it doesn’t need to lean on the worn, pitted post of authentic, gritty realism. The problem is, acknowledging the reality of Call of Duty – what it is and why people enjoy it – is a lot harder than acknowledging the weight of history.</p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"technology/2017/apr/27/amazon-uk-jobs-warrington-warehouse-staff-robot","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-27T10:34:55Z","webTitle":"Amazon creates 1,200 jobs at warehouse equipped with advanced robotics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/27/amazon-uk-jobs-warrington-warehouse-staff-robot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/apr/27/amazon-uk-jobs-warrington-warehouse-staff-robot","fields":{"body":"<p>Amazon is to create 1,200 new permanent jobs as it opens a new warehouse in Warrington where staff will work alongside the online retail giant’s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/p/feature/6emvp3z9gbuf6vz?ref_=aa_bx_3&amp;pf_rd_r=N53FDAT67GD085TTXBBY&amp;pf_rd_p=c52f07da-3837-4fdc-9033-9c31adbaefaf\">robots</a>.</p> <p>The US group said the new fulfilment centre, part of a significant expansion across the UK, will take its workforce in Britain to 24,000 by the end of this year.<br /></p> <p>Amazon will be hiring for a range of new roles including operations managers, engineers, human resources and IT specialists.

Despite upgrading to Windows 10, Disk Cleanup still refers to disk space on Windows8_OS[C]. Is this the problem? Also, 3GB is Temporary Internet files, but deleting Temporary Files in Storage makes little or no difference.</em> <strong>Andy</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>Before we start, I must remind you that you are totally responsible for your own PC and all your personal data. If you are going to run programs that delete files, or worse, you must have everything securely backed up first. Windows 10 includes a backup program that can back up your hard drive and also take a disk image. It’s also a good idea to create recovery media and to make separate copies of irreplaceable data files and family photos.</p> <p>Now, disks usually take a few years to fill up, and the process should be too gradual to notice. When it isn’t, it rings alarm bells that suggest something bad is happening.</p> <p>The most likely “bad thing” is that your PC has a malware infection. Run a spot check with a different anti-virus product such as Malwarebytes, Kaspersky or Hitman Pro, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/apr/13/how-should-i-protect-my-windows-pc-from-malware-and-viruses\">as mentioned in a recent answer</a>. If they don’t find anything, restart your PC in safe mode with networking and run them again.</p> <p>There are other possibilities, such as a runaway media cache, a PC that is creating <a href=\"https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reduce-space-windows-10-system-restore-uses/\">too many system restore points</a>, or an overgrown Windows <a href=\"https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/4c0459bc-8ec5-4770-9d5d-ffef61006ce2/windows-10-and-search-indexer-windowsedb-is-huge?forum=win10itprogeneral \">search index file (windows.edb)</a>. Also, your file system may have been corrupted so it is showing incorrect values. To fix this, run a command prompt as administrator, type in <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc730714(v=ws.11).aspx\">chkdsk C: /f /v /x</a> and schedule a reboot.</p> <p>Either way, Windows8_OS[C] is not the problem. PC manufacturers can call the C: drive whatever they like, so I assume your machine shipped with a Windows8_OS[C] drive. Windows 10 doesn’t change the name when you do an in-place upgrade, so it would have stayed the same. You can change it, if you really want to.</p> <h2><strong>Spring cleaning</strong></h2> <p>Windows includes <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17421/windows-free-up-drive-space\">Disk Cleanup and other facilities</a> for reclaiming hard drive space. However, Piriform’s free <a href=\"https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download\">CCleaner</a> (originally, Crap Cleaner) is the quickest and simplest way to delete temporary internet files, old log files and other accumulated junk. Download it from the original source as there are scammers who charge for it.</p> <p>CCleaner can delete information you want. This includes your browser history, and website details stored in cookies on your hard drive. Before you run it, make sure you know the log-on details and passwords for all your websites, and save the current tabs in all your browsers.</p> <p>For the best results, reboot your PC and run it before starting any programs that may object to CCleaner deleting their data.</p> <p>CCleaner’s Tools section includes utilities to analyse your hard drive and to find duplicate files. However, neither is particularly good, so use separate programs instead.</p> <h2><strong>Duplicate file finders</strong></h2> <p>You may already have a duplicate file finder. If not, there are lots to choose from, so try two or three to find one you like. In general, I prefer de-dupers that let you choose one or two directories to compare. That cuts down the number of comparisons, which speeds up the process. It also makes it easy to avoid back-up and system directories.</p> <p>NirSoft’s <a href=\"http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/search_my_files.html\">SearchMyFiles</a> is a good basic duplicate file finder. You can tell it to stop searching after finding a specific number of duplicates, such as 100, which avoids getting overwhelmed.</p> <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve used Bing Bang Enterprises’ <a href=\"https://www.bigbangenterprises.de/en/doublekiller/\">DoubleKiller</a> on my home PCs. It doesn’t have the simplest user interface but it’s fast, flexible, and does the job.</p> <p>If you have a lot of photos and music files, you could also try <a href=\"http://www.joerg-rosenthal.com/en/antitwin/\">Anti-Twin</a>, which I mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2011/may/20/ask-jack-storing-photo-collection-hard-drive\">2011</a>. Anti-Twin has a “compare file content” option that compares the binary content of various files. It can therefore find dupes that are not identical but very similar, such as different files of the same music track. De-dupers that work on file sizes and CRC or MD5 checks won’t find those. <a href=\"https://www.digitalvolcano.co.uk/duplicatecleaner.html\">Duplicate Cleaner</a> has similar features.</p> <h2><strong>Tracking disk space</strong></h2> <p>If you are running short of hard drive space, it helps to know what’s using it. Disk analysers tell you. Most also provide some sort of visualisation, such as a pie chart or tree-map.</p> <p>As with de-dupers, there are dozens of disk analysers, and most people try a few until they find one they like.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c38440539e77d32fb9faf5e726d68671984ee8df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c38440539e77d32fb9faf5e726d68671984ee8df/0_313_4800_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"usb hard drive.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘You may need to make space by moving some large files to an external hard drive.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeffrey Hamilton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you don’t already have one, Windows Directory Statistics (<a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/windirstat/files/\">WinDirStat</a>) is a popular choice. It lists directories in size order, and you can drill down to find out which folders and then files take up the most space. It also lists the main types of file, so you can see how much space is consumed by MP4 video files, MP3 music files, jpg images. dll files and so on.</p> <p>Freeware alternatives include <a href=\"http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/\">SpaceSniffer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/\">TreeSize Free</a>. There are paid-for programs that will track disk space over time, such as<a href=\"http://www.foldersizes.com/features/diskspacehistory \"> FolderSizes</a>. I don’t know of a simple free program that does this, but geeks can do it by <a href=\"https://superuser.com/a/750414\">scripting Windows’ built-in Performance Monitor</a> (PerfMon).</p> <p>You may need to make space by moving some large files to an external hard drive or burning them to DVD etc.</p> <h2><strong>Check your drive</strong></h2> <p>We are about to tread some dangerous ground, and people of a nervous disposition may want to watch cat videos on YouTube instead. Or download <a href=\"https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree\">Macrium Reflect Free</a> and back up their hard-drive partitions …</p> <p>Press WinKey-X to bring up the super space-cadet menu and either hit k or click Disk Management. This will show you the layout of your hard drive. There should be a Disk 0 recovery partition, installed by the PC manufacturer, plus one or more recovery partitions installed by Windows. Messing around with them may well stop your PC from working.</p> <p>Your PC probably has a separate partition for WinRE, the Windows Recovery Environment. (For more details, see last week’s answer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/apr/20/windows-10-fix-pc-laptop-will-not-boot\">How can I fix my PC when Windows 10 won’t boot?</a>) In Windows 8, WinRE fitted comfortably into a 300MB reserved partition. However, when you upgraded, the new WinRE wouldn’t fit, so Windows 10 probably created a separate 450MB or 500MB partition at the end of the C: drive.</p> <p>All these partitions are too small to bother about. However, Windows 8 also included a copy of the original operating system so that you could reset your PC to factory condition. That would take up at least 5GB, and the manufacturer might reasonably have put it on an 8GB partition. If you find one of those, the space might be worth recovering, but doing it with a partition management program is tedious and somewhat hazardous. (Just deleting the partition creates “unallocated space”: it’s not usable unless you can merge that space into your C: drive.)</p> <p>Given that your current Windows 10 installation needs a clean-up, it might be simpler to download Windows 10 to an empty 8GB thumb drive and do a <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10\">clean installation</a>. This will delete all your existing programs and data, so you really must have everything backed up.</p> <p><strong>Have you got another question for Jack?

It announced key details of its forthcoming Project Scorpio console – an update to the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/xbox-one\"> Xbox One</a> – via a set of exclusive features on the video game news site, Eurogamer. In the modern games industry the strict control of information, especially regarding hardware, has become something of a corporate obsession. To cede control of a major revelation – in this case the technical specifications of a forthcoming machine – was a fascinating, but intelligent move. It added a sense of impartiality and validity to all the specs and stats that came out of the reveal, lending the information some real authority that would have been missing from an official press release. It let gamers start processing the meaning of the machine for themselves.</p> <p>But there are still big questions for Microsoft: Is there really a large enough audience for a high-powered version of a console that’s barely three years into its lifecycle? Is this really just about the 4K television industry? </p> <p>To understand Scorpio, you have to look at what’s happened to Microsoft since the launch of the Xbox 360, a decade ago. That machine was a revelation – powerful, innovative and sporting the best console multiplayer infrastructure around. But in this generation, from the infamous unveiling of the Xbox One (and the pounding Sony gave the machine at E3) to the huge sales of the PlayStation 4, Microsoft has been playing catch-up. Scorpio is very much a full-stop on that – it’s an attempt to reclaim the innovative and technological high ground.</p> <p>Officially announced at the E3 games conference last June, Project Scorpio is an impressively powerful new version of the Xbox One, due out this Christmas. Featuring eight custom x86 cores clocked at 2.3GHz, a 1172MHz graphics processor and 12GB of system memory, it adds considerably to the original machine’s processing power and graphics capabilities. It will, in theory, allow native 4K resolution gaming, at 60 frames-per-second, and with full support for HDR colour – and in terms of processing grunt, it is set to considerably out-perform Sony’s PlayStation 4 Pro. Developers will still need to support the standard Xbox One and Xbox One S iterations with every game they make, but from now on they’ll have the option of supporting the high-end visual feature-set of this new machine. </p> <p>One thing that some gamers immediately picked up on about the new machine specifications however is that it has stuck with AMD’s Jaguar class of processor, which powered the original Xbox One, as well as the PlayStation 4. It’s been highly augmented and customised for Scorpio, but Microsoft hasn’t swapped out the silicon for a newer more powerful processor family. </p> <p>For the head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, this is part of the price/performance compromise that characterises the console industry. “If you said to me, ‘could you or another console manufacturer design a $2,000 console that ran, like, two Titan Xs SLI-d together?’ Then yeah, we could do it. But the console price points aren’t there. If you’re willing to spend a couple of grand building up an i7-based machine with umpteen terabytes of RAM, you can go do that on a PC. But I actually feel with Scorpio we’ve been able to hit a really nice price/performance ratio. When we talk about the price, I think people will see that. It is a premium product, there’s no doubt, but I think relative to the PC that you could go buy at this spec, you’re gonna feel really good.”</p> <p>He’s still not talking about price (or the final name of the machine), but current conjecture is $499/£499, and that would certainly fit with his idea of Project Scorpio as a ‘premium’ machine that’s not priced massively outside of the console space. The big question though is – who will buy Scorpio? Who is it for? The Xbox One S, released last August upgrades the original console by offering HDR capabilities, 4K video playback and upscaled game visuals, which for a lot of people – is enough. Titles like Forza Horizon 3 and Gears of War 4 already look amazing on 4K televisions. Also, a majority of gamers are yet to make the switch to 4K sets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea9d2671f85aba0b5c502ed6f0a6242c14fa38ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea9d2671f85aba0b5c502ed6f0a6242c14fa38ef/250_80_1262_757/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Project Scorpio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Scorpio is for the console customer who wants the best version of the console games on their television.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft /youtube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Spencer, though, Scorpio isn’t exclusively a 4K proposition: according to Microsoft, the console will make use of its improved rendering and processing power to improve the frame rates and general visual performance of games, <a href=\"http://www.windowscentral.com/project-scorpio-supersampling-for-1080p-tvs\">even when viewed on a 1080p screen</a>. In effect, current Xbox One games that use dynamic resolution scaling (ie they have the ability to output visuals at higher resolutions when the hardware allows) will exploit the Scorpio’s power to improve the graphical performance on 1080p, while any titles released later to specifically target 4K, will also super-sample down for 1080p displays so that those owners get some of the benefits, including <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2017-scorpio-is-console-hardware-pushed-to-a-new-level\">improved anti-aliasing and texture filtering</a>.</p> <p>“I think Scorpio is for the console customer who wants the best version of the console games on their television, whether they have a 1080p or a 4K television,” he says. “We’ve got a higher frequency CPU than any other console, we’ve got a better GPU, we’ve got more RAM. I have a Scorpio at home, so I’ve moved it back and forth from a 1080p TV to a 4K TV – and if you’re running on a 1080p TV and you plug Scorpio in you’re gonna be able to tell. I can tell.”</p> <p>So does this mean we’re going to get smooth frame rates and draw distance on titles like Witcher 3, which push current hardware to its limits? “We took a distinctive approach with Scorpio to say we want all games to run well,” says Spencer. “Every game should get access to the full capabilities of the hardware, whether the game was written two years ago for Xbox One, 10 years ago for 360, or is yet to be shipped. You’re gonna see games that shipped on Xbox One that just natively run better on Scorpio, because you have the CPU and GPU power, and things like scalable resolution, which Halo used. You’re just gonna find that it’s running at a higher resolution a lot of the time, or all the time – and if the team does specific work for Scorpio obviously then there’s a ton of headroom to go do something great.”</p> <p>According to Spencer a key aim has been to give developers the options to support Scorpio the way they want – and Microsoft is therefore guarded about setting performance targets. However, in <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/295830/QA_With_Scorpio_rising_Phil_Spencer_looks_to_the_future_of_Xbox.php\">a recent interview with Gamasutra</a>, Spencer mentioned a specific benchmark for Scorpio titles: native 4K resolution, 30 frames-per-second. How did that figure come about? “We looked at games on Xbox One that were running at 30-frames-per-second in 1080p, or sometimes 900p, and we said, ‘If you’re running at 1080 30 on Xbox, we want to make sure that we give you the hardware capability to run at 30 in 4K’,” he says. “The only reason I focused on 30fps is because we have a lot of those on Xbox One. </p> <p>“But we’re not dictating that that’s what developers do. They can make other decisions with resolution and framerate, and <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2017-forza-motorsport-on-project-scorpio-the-full-story\">the Forza stuff we have shown</a> was running at 60fps, 4K. You’ll have people who do that, and you’ll have people who’ll make decisions to do less than a native 4K frame buffer.”</p> <p>“When developers come into the labs and port their engines over to Scorpio, we say, ‘Hey, start with your high-end PC settings, and then see what happens’. We’ve been really pleasantly surprised by the results, because you don’t know what’s gonna happen when you start running third-party engines.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8d10fd6ac3b0a3470108672d52f7088f5c513c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8d10fd6ac3b0a3470108672d52f7088f5c513c7/17_0_963_578/500.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft has shown ForzaTech running in 60 frames-per-second in 4K on Scorpio\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Microsoft has shown ForzaTech running in 60 frames-per-second in 4K on Scorpio</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Microsoft</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Spencer won’t be drawn on the ratio of Xbox developers who are specifically targeting Scorpio-level capabilities, v the number who simply plan to add the most rudimentary support for the hardware in their forthcoming releases. But he’s realistic about it. “Teams will target big market segments,” he says. “The largest installed base will be Xbox One, for us, right, and they’re gonna want to sell to that. The difference, though, is that it’s the Scorpio customer that buys the most games. So teams may say ‘Hey, I’m just gonna do an Xbox One version of the game, and it’ll run better in Scorpio but I’m not gonna do anything specific to take advantage of Scorpio beyond just what I get from CPU and GPU,’ and you’ll have other teams that say, ‘I know my customer is the Scorpio customer’. I always want to give the tools to the creatives and let them make the decisions.”</p> <p>When pushed on how far developers will be able to take their specialist support of Scorpio, Spencer is also ambiguous. With the extra RAM and processing power, it may be possible for some teams to add extra gameplay content only accessible to Scorpio owners. This, he says, hasn’t been broached yet – but again, he’s preaching flexibility, and an openness to what the creatives want to do. “These are decisions I think it’s better for us to make in the context of specific game ideas that people have,” he says. “We’re in constant dialogue with developers about the ways they would like to exploit the Scorpio hardware. All of the ideas teams have come back with today are about how to make the game feel and look better on Scorpio. We haven’t had many people that have wanted to create a gameplay difference.”</p> <p>In effect, Scorpio is doing the same job as PlayStation 4 Pro. Both are recognitions of the fact that 4K screens are now selling in larger and larger numbers and that these consoles have to support the market surge. But while PlayStation 4 Pro, which came out in November, offers a slightly compromised vision of the native 4K experience, Scorpio is a powerful, intricately designed upgrade. It is, perhaps, the Samsung Galaxy S8 to Sony’s iPhone 7; the Sennheiser Momentum to Sony’s Beats – we’ll have to judge it when it arrives. For now, what it very much is, is a statement of intent.</p> <p>“Three years ago we were in a position where maybe our hardware wasn’t touted as the best in the market,” says Spencer. “Now I can say, OK, from the Xbox One S to Scorpio, I’m incredibly proud of our hardware lineup relative to anybody else’s.” Xbox One has lagged behind PlayStation 4 in many respects - now we may be about to feel the sting in its tail. </p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"technology/2017/apr/26/palantir-racial-discrimination-lawsuit-asians-peter-thiel","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-26T19:17:39Z","webTitle":"Palantir to pay $1.7m over accusation it discriminates against Asian applicants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/26/palantir-racial-discrimination-lawsuit-asians-peter-thiel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/apr/26/palantir-racial-discrimination-lawsuit-asians-peter-thiel","fields":{"body":"<p>Palantir, a Silicon Valley company with ties to Donald Trump, has agreed to pay $1.7m to settle a government lawsuit alleging racial discrimination against Asian applicants. </p> <p>The $20bn data analytics company, co-founded by Peter Thiel, one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/10/silicon-valley-right-wing-donald-trump-peter-thiel\">president’s advisers</a>, has not admitted wrongdoing in the settlement, which comes at a time of increasing debate about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/01/silicon-valley-sexual-harassment-startups\">discrimination in the tech industry</a>. </p> <p>The payout, negotiated by the Trump administration’s Department of Labor (DoL), comes amid concern in Silicon Valley over the immigration and labor policies likely to be enacted by the White House. </p> <p>Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has previously suggested he believes there are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bannon-flattered-and-coaxed-trump-on-policies-key-to-the-alt-right/2016/11/15/53c66362-ab69-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html?utm_term=.6009ca122bc1\">too many Asian</a> executives in Silicon Valley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/15/steve-hilton-im-rich-but-i-understand-the-frustrations-people-have\">Steve Hilton: 'I’m rich, but I understand the frustrations people have'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the final year of Barack Obama’s administration, labor officials targeted the California tech sector with high-profile lawsuits alleging discriminatory employment practices at Palantir, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/07/google-pay-disparities-women-labor-department-lawsuit\">Oracle</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20170104\">Google</a>. </p> <p>While there have been concerns about the fate of these cases under Trump, given the president’s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/21/oracle-executive-resigns-ceo-safra-catz-donald-trump\">connections to key tech executives</a> and his ongoing efforts to undo <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-repeals-regulation-wage-theft_us_58d9408ee4b03692bea814c9?section=politics\">labor protections</a>, the Palantir resolution suggests that the DoL is pushing forward with its Obama-era enforcement efforts. </p> <p>The agreement – which establishes a consent decree requiring Palantir to pay $1,659,434 in back wages and other monetary relief – comes weeks after the DoL <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/07/google-pay-disparities-women-labor-department-lawsuit\">accused Google of systematically underpaying women</a>. </p> <p>An official with the department, which is seeking to force the internet search giant to hand over more internal data, told the Guardian: “The government’s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry.”</p> <p>The labor department first filed the suit against Palantir in September, alleging that the Palo Alto-based company used a discriminatory hiring process in which Asian applicants “were routinely eliminated in the résumé screen and telephone interview phases despite being as qualified as white applicants”.</p> <p>Like Google and Oracle, Palantir is a federal contractor, which means it is required to follow a higher standard of equal opportunity laws and provide the government data for audits. </p> <p>The DoL suit, which sought lost wages, said that from a pool of more than 1,160 qualified software engineer applicants, approximately 85% were Asian, but the company hired 14 non-Asian employees and only 11 Asian people.

However, the Silicon Valley company, which has never turned a profit, cheered investors by announcing a significant rise in the number of monthly users, to 328 million. <br /></p> <p>Shares in the company, which hit a peak of $69 in 2014, rose by more than 10% to $16.14 on Wednesday as the revenue and user number figures exceeded analysts’ expectations. </p> <p>Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and chief executive, said he was “proud to report” that the number of active daily users had increased for the fourth consecutive quarter and was up 14% on this time last year. But he conceded that the company, which has never made a profit, was still battling “revenue headwinds”. </p> <p>The San Francisco-based firm reported an 8% fall in first-quarter revenue to $548m (£427m). It is the company’s first fall in year-on-year quarterly revenue since it floated on the stock market in 2013.</p> <p>Advertising revenue for the three-month period fell 11% to at $474m, but the drop was softer than the $443m that analysts had predicted.

The loss amounts to almost $700,000 a day.</p> <p>“While we continue to face revenue headwinds, we believe that executing on our plan and growing our audience should result in positive revenue growth over the long term,” Dorsey said. <br /></p> <p>The company pointed to its success in increasing engagement from users on a daily basis but did not provide figures for the number of daily users.

But he said the issue for investors was: “When do things get less worse?”</p> <p>Twitter, which was touted for sale last year but failed to find a buyer, has been pushed into the spotlight as President Trump has used the service to get his message across directly to the electorate bypassing what he regards as the “dishonest” media, both before and after the presidential election. </p> <p>The company did not directly credit Trump for helping to drive user growth, but said that new users tended to follow more political accounts. “Having the political leaders of the world as well as news agencies participating on Twitter is an important part of reinforcing [engagement],” Anthony Noto, Twitter’s chief operating officer, said. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/09/twitter-loses-advertising-revenue-rise-users-shares\">Twitter loses ad revenue despite gaining 2 million users and Trump 'boost'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said: “Trump drives a lot of awareness about Twitter among people who otherwise wouldn’t be paying attention.

Those rules ensured that the internet would remain a level playing field for everyone, making the internet America’s foundation for information and commerce and communications. We are on the right side of history and I’m ready for this fight to come.”</p> <p>Craig Aaron, president of consumer-advocacy group Free Press, said the Trump’s administration was trying to erase “one of the most important public interest victories ever.” Such a move would leave consumers “at the mercy of the phone and cable companies, some of the most hated companies in America.”</p> <p>Aaron said Pai was living in a “fantasy world, where all will be fine if internet companies double-pinky swear not to interfere with online pathways and portals – despite their long history of doing just that.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fpbOEoRrHyU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The previous battle over net neutrality led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/02/net-neutrality-activists-fcc-big-cable-republicans\">massive outpouring</a> of public support.

Although it bears all the hallmarks of games like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/apr/26/gone-home-telling-everyday-stories\">Gone Home</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/06/dear-esther-original-walking-simulator-playstation-4-xbox-one\">Dear Esther</a> with its spooky waterside property, its readable letters and journey entries, and its lack of a “run” button, the game soon strays from the familiar paths trodden by those seminal “walking simulators”. Instead, What Remains delivers a collection of whimsical tales that leap deftly from one genre to another without ever losing the thread at the heart story.</p> <p>The eponymous Edith is the last remaining member of the cursed Finch family, who have all died in strange circumstances, some of them at a young age. She is returning to the family home to find out what happened to them all. After each Finch death, the person’s bedroom was sealed up, never to be used again, resulting in a rambling, crooked tower of a house, with rooms tacked on here and there over time. In this way, the house acts as a grounding hub for the game, a visual metaphor for the messiness and chaos of life and a physical manifestation of the Finch family tree.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"796399601b94de29620a5d729f004fe41423319e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/796399601b94de29620a5d729f004fe41423319e/46_0_1799_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What Remains of Edith Finch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The level of detail means that really understanding a space takes more than a moment’s pause.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annapurna Interactive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first glance, this seems like a dramatic departure from developer Giant Sparrow’s, first indie hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/jun/07/unfinished-swan-games-preview\">Unfinished Swan</a>. Gone is the interesting ink-splash gameplay mechanic, gone is the stark white fairy tale city, and in their place is more conventional, beautifully rendered visuals. But scratch the surface and What Remains shares the same themes of folkloric wonder, as well as the storybook structure of its predecessor. At times, a character climbs into books, in scenes reminiscent of The Neverending Story or Alice in Wonderland.</p> <p>Giant Sparrow seamlessly transports the player from one character to another, shifting viewpoints and time periods through three generations of a family. To describe any of the stories within the game is to say too much, as each chapter is so distinct from the last in terms of gameplay, aesthetic and setting. The only thing every episode shares is the first-person perspective and simple move, look and click controls. Only in one brief flying and swimming sequence did the interface feel like a hindrance; otherwise it is beautifully integrated. The analogue stick is used to turn a key in a lock, or wind up a music box and turn the pages of book. The effect is tactile rather than testing.</p> <p>The interior of the house is a character in itself, and to learn more about it, you have to explore. The level of detail means that really understanding a space takes more than a moment’s pause, but nothing in the world is surplus: the clutter has a narrative purpose. A wheelchair with an oxygen bottle attached tells one story, as does the modern stairlift in this old house. Even the takeaway boxes and the dishes still smeared with food have a tale to tell. And then there are the books.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The Finches were obviously big readers because books are stacked everywhere. The titles vary depending on whose room you’re in – in one you may find Treasure Island sitting beside a book on Japanese manners, in another you’ll see a favourite family cookbook lying open on the table, as if it has been left mid-read. And the game itself acts as a book, with text sitting along the top of a gate or wrapping around the back of an armchair, as Edith narrates. Words may dissolve or letters scatter in the wind, depending where the story travels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cf82d5dcb84a3a9c40ad62b5834a8d9d081eb05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cf82d5dcb84a3a9c40ad62b5834a8d9d081eb05/121_0_1799_1080/1000.png\" alt=\"What Remains of Edith Finch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Each beautifully detailed bedroom is a mausoleum for a Finch relative.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annapurna Interactive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each beautifully detailed bedroom is a mausoleum for a Finch relative, but all the doors are locked, so the path inside is often ingenious and disorienting. A hatch in the floor of one room leads to a tunnel, which then leads to a ladder in another and then Edith climbs through a picture to find the story within. As she explores the rooms, she’s transported into tales of the characters’ last moments. These stories-within-a-story play with ideas of the unreliable narrator, as well as the blurring of fiction and reality. It’s a game about the stories families tell each other and how memories become fiction and then history, before morphing into their own kind of truth.</p> <p>One episode splits the controls between the “real” world and an imagined one, in a story that is designed to resonate with gamers in particular. In another, 10-year-old Molly is the narrator of a Lovecraftian trip that transports the player into different bodies. It should be nightmarish, but the episode evokes the ghoulishness of nursery rhymes such as There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly, so anyone expecting jump scares and horror will be disappointed. Instead, there are monsters under the bed, magical storms that conjure up The Wizard of Oz, a brilliant homage to Weird Tales comics and an incredible water sequence that evokes the wonder and whimsy of Disney’s Fantasia.</p> <p>This tragic family saga uses literature as its inspiration, with more than a touch of the magical realism of Gabriel García Márquez, as well as the more obvious influences of Lovecraft and weird fiction. If Wes Anderson made a game it would feel like What Remains of Edith Finch (maybe with more pink), with its eccentric cast of characters and fanciful events that always fit together as a cohesive whole.</p> <p>What Remains of Edith Finch is a game that succeeds in recreating the childhood joy of reading a book and being utterly transported into its pages, only to reach the end and realise it’s not real. It will touch the heart of all but the most soulless of gamers.</p> <p><strong>Annapurna Interactive; PS4 (version tested)/PC/Mac; £15; Pegi rating: 16+</strong></p>"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"technology/2017/apr/26/chatterbox-wednesday","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2017-04-26T06:00:29Z","webTitle":"Chatterbox: Wednesday","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/26/chatterbox-wednesday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2017/apr/26/chatterbox-wednesday","fields":{"body":"<p>Chatterbox is the Guardian’s daily venue for video game-themed discussion.
